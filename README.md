# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot

**Overview:**
This project is an autonomous obstacle-avoiding car built using Arduino. It detects obstacles in its path using ultrasonic sensors and intelligently maneuvers around them. The goal is to demonstrate basic robotics and automation principles.

**Components Used:**
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) for distance measurement
- Motor Driver Module (L293D) to control the wheels
- DC Motors (for movement)
- Power Supply (Battery or external power)
- Chassis & Wheels

**Working:**
- The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to obstacles.
- If an obstacle is detected within a threshold range, the car adjusts its movement accordingly.
- The motor driver controls the speed and direction based on sensor readings.

**Steps Involved/Procedure:**
- Assemble the Hardware Components using the **Circuit Diagram.**
- Attach the setup with chassis.
- Upload the code on your **Arduino Uno** with the help of the **Code provided.**
- Power the Arduino using a battery.
- **Obstacle Avoiding Robot** is successfully made.
